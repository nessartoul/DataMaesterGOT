In this project I used Game of Thrones data i found from data.world to look
at the deaths over 8 seasons of Game of Thrones. I did this  by aggregating the number of kills.

I found the Deadliest Houses, Allegiances, and Locations. Then created an interactive dashboard
to guide you through Westeros as you make your own risk based decisions.

The goal for this project was to see what Tableau is capable of from a formatting
and design aspect and using multiple filters.
